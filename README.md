# Markdown preview for terminal

this little nodejs program parses a markdown file and opens it at localhost with default browser

pretty cool right?


## how to install

just run these commands -_-

```
git clone https://github.com/neolabs-software/markdown-preview ; cd markdown-preview
npm install
sudo npm link
```

if it works, then you should be able to run markdown-preview and see an output

## using

syntax is just like

```
markdown-preview [markdown file] [port]
```
